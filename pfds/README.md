# Purely Functional Data Structures (In Haskell)

This is a section for writing programs described in "Purely Functional Data Structures" by Chris Okasaki (1996). The code was originally written in Standard ML, but I am doing my best to write the programs in Haskell instead which support lazy evaluation by default (something the book uses a lot).
