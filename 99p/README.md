# 99 Problems in Haskell

There's a classic Lisp challenge called ["99 Problems in Lisp"](http://www.ic.unicamp.br/~meidanis/courses/mc336/2006s2/funcional/L-99_Ninety-Nine_Lisp_Problems.html), but for people studying Haskell this is often used as a challenging practice to solve all (or at least some) of these 99 problems in Haskell.

Problems are organized into folders based on general problem area.
